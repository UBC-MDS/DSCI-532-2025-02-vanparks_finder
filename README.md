## What are we doing? {#what-are-we-doing}

### The problem

Did you know that there are over 216 parks in Vancouver?

For park enthusiasts in **Vancouver**, finding the **right park** that meets their specific needs—whether it’s **size, washrooms, or facilities**—can be a frustrating trial-and-error process. Visiting multiple locations just to check if a park fits their requirements **wastes time and effort**.

### The solution

The Vanparks Finder app will:

-   Find parks based on their location in their respective neighbourhoods.

-   Filter parks based on key features like size, washrooms, and available facilities.

-   Quickly see park statistics, such as total number of parks in an area and their combined land area.

-   Use the dashboard to find particular facilities and discover new green places.
