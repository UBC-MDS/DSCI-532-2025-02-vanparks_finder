During this milestone, our team successfully developed several key features for the dashboard. We implemented the neighbourhood name zoom capability, enabling users to zoom into the map location of a specific neighbourhood by clicking on its name. Additionally, we replaced the previous click-based interaction with hover-over functionality to display the name of the park on the map.

To improve spatial visualization, we created an overlay of Vancouver's neighbourhood boundaries and made them clickable. When a specific neighbourhood is selected, the boundary of that area is highlighted, enhancing map interaction by focusing on the chosen region. However, we encountered an implementation difficulty: originally, the borders extended to all neighbourhoods, making it impossible for users to concentrate on certain locations. We fixed the issue by changing the functionality such that the borders display only when a certain neighbourhood is selected, resulting in a more clear and focused user experience.One feature that has not yet been implemented is the use of different colours for each neighbourhood's borders.Currently, all boundaries are presented in red, making it difficult to distinguish between adjacent sections. In the future, we plan to assign various colours to each neighbourhood's borders to improve visual differentiation and make it easier for users to identify individual areas on the map.

We used to have the toggle filter for washroom availability, where selecting "Yes" would display only parks with washrooms. We have now updated it to a washroom toggle, allowing users to check or uncheck the "Washroom Availability" option to control whether parks with washrooms are shown on the map. This change makes the functionality more clear. Additionally, to enhance the user experience, we ensured that all the text fits the screen without requiring scrolling.

For better organization, we modularized the code, dividing it into components such as Filter.py, map.py, bar_chart.py, and count_box.py. This modular structure, similar to a single-page app framework, has separate files for callbacks, components, and data management, making the code easier to maintain and scale. These adjustments were fully implemented, resolving the earlier technical difficulty.

While our dashboard functions well by providing essential functionality such as interactive neighbourhood boundaries, washroom toggles, and clear spatial visualizations, we have noticed a few limitations. One area for improvement is the Special Feature selection, which presently provides identical features with minor changes (for example, "Perimeter Walking Path (730m)" and "Perimeter Walking Path"). Grouping these related components would assist to avoid misunderstanding and make the user interface more intuitive.

Another limitation is the hover-over tooltips for the pins on the map. In this milestone,we have currently enabled hover functionality on park markers, which displays the park name when the user hovers over the pin. In the future, we intend to improve this by including hover-over tooltips that provide quick access to key information about each park. This will allow users to compare parks more easily without having to click on the markers, improving accessibility and making the user experience more straightforward.
