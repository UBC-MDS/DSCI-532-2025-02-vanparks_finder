Since Milestone 3, our dashboard has remained stable in structure. We have reoptimized the zooming feature so that when a user filters for a specific neighbourhood, they can see the entire neighbourhood along with all the parks within it. Additionally, we have improved the washroom filter by caching it, which makes the change almost instantaneous when the user selects this option. As recommended by one of our reviewers, we also pre-processed the dataset to ensure smoother functionality. In Milestone 3, our "Special Feature" filter included separate options for "Wedding Ceremony Site" and "Wedding Ceremony Site x3". Since these represent the same type of feature, we decided to group them together for clarity and ease of use. This change helps simplify the interface and avoids redundancy.

One feature that we were unable to implement within the given timeframe was a component that displays map details, which would slide in from the right side of the dashboard. The goal was to allow users to continue interacting with the map while the component updates based on the park marker they select. Currently, when a user clicks on a marker, a pop-up appears, and they must close it before interacting with the dashboard again. We believe that implementing this sliding pop-out would significantly improve the user experience.

At present, our dashboard serves its primary purpose well. Users can easily find specific parks based on their desired amenitiesâ€”such as basketball courts, the presence of a seawall, or available washrooms. However, feedback from our peer-review session pointed out a few limitations. One notable suggestion was that users are currently unable to determine how far a park is from their current location. A reviewer recommended adding a feature where the user can input a location, select a park from the map, and then view the distance between their input location and the park. This was not part of our initial design, but after considering the suggestion, we see how valuable such a feature would be for users. Although it would require additional time and expertise with Dash, we plan to implement this feature in the future.
Another helpful suggestion from the peer review was to revise the title of our bar chart. Originally labeled "Top 5 Facilities," it was recommended that we change it to "Most Common Facilities" to ensure that the chart's purpose is more easily understood by users. Although this was a small change, our team had overlooked it, and fine-tuning details like this is important for enhancing the professionalism of the dashboard.

While our dashboard has met its initial goals and continues to function well, we acknowledge that there are areas for improvement based on the feedback we received. By implementing some of these suggestions, we believe we can further improve the user experience, making the dashboard more intuitive and functional. If given more time and additional expertise, we are excited about the possibility of adding features like the location-based distance calculator and improving the interactivity of map elements.
